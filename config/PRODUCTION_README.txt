For some reason I cannot get sprockets to behave with the production deployment. Assets are compiled but not getting
added to pages they are required in. Since the app only uses a handful of users, for now, the performance benefits of the
asset pipeline can be ignored...

**** IMPORTANT ****
The production version of the application runs in DEVELOPMENT mode, although connects to the production database instance.
