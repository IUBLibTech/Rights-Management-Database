  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="intro">User Guide</h3>
  <p>RMD is an online application that records rights metadata to facilitate publishing content in Media Collections
    Online (MCO). RMD acts as the authority for level of access at which a given MCO item can be published. MCO enforces
    the access level RMD reports by preventing a collection manager from publishing at a <i><b>broader
    level of access</b></i> than RMD stipulates. Collection managers are free to publish any MCO item at a more
    restrictive level of access than RMD reports.</p>
  <p>As an example, an item assigned <i>IU Only Access</i> in RMD can be published with IU Only Access or Restricted
    Access in MCO. Since Worldwide access is <i>less restrictive</i> than IU Only, MCO will not permit publishing the item at
    worldwide access. </p>
  <p><b><i>&#42; Because IU Legal has cleared access at the IU Only level for all MDPI content, items begin life in RMD with
    a “default” level of access denoted by “Default IU Access – Not Reviewed”. This corresponds to IU Only Access but
    indicates that the item has not yet been reviewed for access. </i></b></p>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="content">How RMD Generates Content</h3>
  <p>RMD periodically scans MCO for its latest additions. When new items are found, the metadata for those items is read by
    RMD and corresponding <i>Avalon Items</i> are created in RMD. Because MCO collects descriptive metadata, only basic
    metadata fields are populated in RMD: title, MDPI barcodes, and digital files. As a convenience feature, the full MCO
    metadata scan is viewable while in RMD at the bottom of an avalon item's page.</p>
  <p><b><i>* It is important to note that because RMD periodically <i>polls</i> MCO for new additions, there is a minor
    delay between the time a record is pushed from Dark Avalon into MCO, and the time it is created in RMD.</i></b></p>

  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-lg" id="workflow">Workflow and UI in RMD</h3>
  <p>When a collection manager logs in, using the same ADS Group permissions as MCO, their home page lists only those MCO
    items which they are permitted to manage. The home page provides a listing of their MCO content organizable by
    4 RMD-defined workflow statuses. Each status describes the stage an Avalon Item is at, in the process of
    determining access. Color coded buttons across the top of this list provide easy filtering of content based on the
    workflow statuses. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'workflow.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Default Access</b> – this is the starting status for every avalon item and denotes items for which an access
      determination has not yet been made.</li>
    <li><b>Review Requested</b> – this status denotes items for which copyright librarian review has been requested. </li>
    <li><b>Responses</b> – this status denotes items for which copyright librarian review has been requested and the
      copyright librarian <i><u>has responded without making an access determination</u></i>. This typically indicates
      there is not enough metadata to determine access for the avalon item.</li>
    <li><b>Access Determined</b> – this status denotes items which have had an access determination made, either by the
      collection manager or the copyright librarian. These items are ready to be published in MCO. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The work of determining access for a given avalon item generally falls into one of two categories. </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>A collection manager knows what access can be assigned to an item</b> - In this instance, a collection manager
      would record any necessary rights information and then set the Access Determination on the item. The item is now
      ready to publish in MCO. </li>
    <li><b>A collection manager needs Copyright Librarian research to determine access</b> - The collection manager records
      all available rights-related metadata and then requests review of the item. To request review, click the Request
      Review button at the top of the avalon item page. A popup will appear where the collection manager can provide
      comments to the copyright librarian. <i>The more metadata provided prior to this request, the easier it will be for
      the copyright librarian to determine access, and the less likely the item will move into the "response" status
      mentioned above.</i> </li>
  </ul>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="ui">Avalon Item User Interface</h3>
  <p>The page displaying an Avalon Item can be broken into two main areas: metadata fields for the Avalon Item and the
    imported metadata from MCO. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'avalon_item_a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <p>The first row of controls for the avalon item metadata includes the following:</p>
  <%= image_tag 'row1a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Title</b> – The title of the item as it appears in MCO. Clicking this will open a new browser tab to the MCO
      instance of this item. Because MCO and RMD use different implementation of authenticating IU credentials, you may
      need to login to MCO prior to this working correctly.</li>
    <li><b>Workflow Status</b> – the label immediately right of the title displays one of the same workflow statuses
      that appear on the home page, describing where this avalon item is in its workflow. This label changes as the
      avalon item moves through workflow, to reflect the current state of the avalon item.
    </li>
    <li><b>Review Button</b> – This button is the way the avalon items move through workflow statuses, and also manages
      communication between collection manager and copyright librarian. If an avalon item is in any other workflow status
      than “Default Access”, hovering over this button will display all communication between collection manager and
      copyright librarian. The text that appears in this button reflects the workflow status as follows:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Request Review</b> – this corresponds to the “Default Access” workflow status that all avalon items begin in.
          Clicking this will notify the copyright librarian that review of the item has been requested. <b><i>* Collection
          managers should fill in all available rights-related metadata prior to requesting copyright librarian review.</i></b> </li>
        <li><b>Add Addition Comments</b> – This corresponds to the “Review Requested” workflow status. While in this state,
          collection managers can provide additional “review” comments for the copyright librarian by clicking this.</li>
        <li><b>Respond to Copyright Librarian</b> – This corresponds to the “Responses” workflow status. This indicates
          that the copyright librarian has sent a comment to the collection manager detailing why an access determination
          cannot be made at this point in time.</li>
        <li><b>Request Re-review</b> – This corresponds to the “Access Determined” workflow status. As circumstances
          change related to rights (death, copyright, legal agreement expiration, etc.), avalon items may require
          re-review to ascertain whether access can or should be modified. Clicking this button initiates that process.
          <b><i>Collection managers should detail what information has changed in the comment to the copyright librarian.</i></b> </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The second row of controls and metadata fields for the avalon item contains the following: </p>
  <%= image_tag 'row2.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li id="access_reasons"><b>Access Determination/System Calculated Access Determination</b> – The access determination drop down menu is
      where users select <i>the broadest level of access</i> the avalon item could be published in MCO, after all rights
      considerations have been taken into account. Collection managers are still free to publish at a more restrictive
      level of access in MCO, but should record the broadest allowable level here. <b>System calculated access</b> is a utility
      that compares all access determinations <i>within the avalon item's structured metadata (See
      <a href="#structure">How RMD Structures Metadata below)</a></i> and determines the
      broadest level allowed by those determinations. This value is meant as a guideline for collection managers. It
      does not restrict collection managers in any way</li>
    <li><b>Access Determination Reason</b> – This field is a quick summary of the reason an access determination was made.
      The values here vary depending on the type of access assigned to the avalon item as detailed below. <br>
      <i><b>* This value does not replace metadata. Collection managers should still fill out all rights related metadata
        in their respective place.</b></i>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Restricted Access</b> - When collection managers restrict access, they are <b><i>required</i></b> to
          select one or more reasons the avalon item is being restricted. These reasons include:
          <ul>
            <li>Ethical/Privacy Considerations</li>
            <li>Feature Film</li>
            <li>Licensing Restriction</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>IU Access – Reviewed</b> - When collection managers set this access level, nothing else is required. However,
          collection managers may <i>optionally</i> select 'In Copyright' as the reason. </li>
        <li><b>Worldwide Access</b> - When collection managers set this level of access, they are required to select a reason
          this level as well as providing additional metadata depending on the reason(s) chosen:
          <ul>
            <li><b>IU Owned/Produced</b> - structured metadata must detail that IU owns or produced the item. </li>
            <li><b>Legal Agreement</b> – the Legal Agreement detailing this must be present in avalon item metadata (see <b> #4. Legal Agreements</b> below). </li>
            <li><b>Public Domain</b> – structured metadata must detail why the item is in the public domain. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>History</b> - this dropdown menu displays a list of all access determinations made for the avalon item, as well as the date and
      user that set these levels. </li>
    <li><b>Legal Agreements</b> – this section provides a means to describe one or more legal agreements that apply to the avalon item. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The remaining avalon item metadata fields/controls include :</p>
  <%= image_tag 'row 3.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Avalon Item Notes</b> – A control that allows a collection manager to include a “note”. This could be useful
      metadata that cannot be captured in any other field, or something meaningful to the collection manager. </li>
    <li><b>Show Structured Metadata</b> – This toggle displays/hides the structured metadata for the Avalon Item. Avalon
      items default behavior is to have this metadata toggled off. Once metadata has been added to the structured
      hierarchy, subsequent viewing of the avalon item will always have this toggled on. </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="controls">Structured Metadata and User Interface Controls</h3>
  <p>Once toggled on, the structured metadata of the avalon item is visible. There are also controls for the
    creation/editing/and deletion of items within each part of the structure.</p>
  <%= image_tag 'structure.png', { :class => "scale" } %>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="structure">How RMD Structures Metadata</h3>
  <p>As mentioned perviously, individual items within MCO are represented in RMD as <i>Avalon Items</i>. In RMD, an Avalon
    Item is a structure hierarchy of physical and conceptual elements. The first level of this hierarchy is the avalon
    item itself. The next level of this hierarchy consists of one or more <i>Recordings</i> which represent the individual
    digital files that make up the MCO item. Each Recording can further be broken down into one or more <i>Performances</i>.
    A performance represents a conceptual structure, loosely representing a moment in time. One example being a concert performed
    on Oct 7, 1983, in Auer Hall. Each performance can further be broken down into one or more <i>Tracks</i>, the final
    level of the structured metadata. A Track typically represents an individual work performed by one or more performers.</p>
  <p>In addition to this hierarchical structure, RMD also allows the associating of individual <i>Works</i> and
    <i>People/Entities</i> to different parts of the structured metadata. Works which have rights considerations can be
    associated at the Track level. A Work represents intellectual property, examples being a speech, musical composition,
    script, etc. People/Entities represent individuals (people) and institutions (entities) that contribute to the creation of works,
    production of recordings, depositing of content with IU, or the performance of works on tracks. When people/entities
    are associated with something in the structured metadata, their involvement at that level in the structure is defined
    by their <i><b>Role</b></i>. See <a href="#people">People/Entities</a> and <a href="#works">Works</a> below for more on roles.</p>
  <p>Recordings represent each digital file the MCO item is comprised of and consist of the following metadata fields
    and UI controls. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'recording a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Title</b> – the title of the recording. By default, this is a combination of the MCO item’s title concatenated with
      the MDPI barcode of the source recording. </li>
    <li><b>Recording Description</b> – The default value here is imported from the MCO item summary field. </li>
    <li>
      <b>Copyright fields</b> (from left to right, top to bottom)
      <ul>
        <li><b>In Copyright</b> - whether the recording is currently in copyright</li>
        <li><b>Copyright End Date</b> - the date the copyright ends</li>
        <li><b>Commercial</b> - whether the recording is commercial</li>
        <li><b>Published</b> – whether the recording has been published </li>
        <li><b>Date of First Publication</b> – when the recording was published </li>
        <li><b>Creation Date</b> – when the recording was created </li>
        <li><b>Country of First Publication</b> – the country in which the item was first published </li>
        <li><b>Authority Source</b> – the name of the authority that this information was obtained from. </li>
        <li><b>Authority Source URL</b> – the URL of the authority source’s record from which this information was obtained </li>
        <li><b>Notes</b> - any additional information that does not fit into one of the above fields</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Edit Button</b> – click to edit these metadata fields. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Performances are comprised of the following metadata fields and UI controls.</p>
  <%= image_tag 'performance a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Create New Performance Button</b> – to add additional performances to a recording, click this </li>
    <li><b>Title</b> – The title of the performance. The default-created performance every recording begins with is titled “Default Performance” </li>
    <li>
      <b>Performance Metadata Fields </b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Location</b> – where the performance was recorded. </li>
        <li><b>Date</b> – the date of the performance. </li>
        <li><b>Access Determination</b> – the level of access the <i>performance</i> has </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Modify Performance Buttons</b> – click to edit metadata fields or delete the performance </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Tracks are comprised of the following metadata fields and UI controls. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'track a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Create New Track Button</b> – to create additional tracks for this performance, click here </li>
    <li><b>Title</b> – the title of the track. </li>
    <li>
      <b>Track Metadata Fields </b>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Access Determination</b> – the access determination for the <i>track</i>. </li>
        <li><b>Start Time</b> – the timestamp in the recording when the track begins. In in hh:mm:ss format. </li>
        <li><b>End Time</b> – the timestamp in the recording when the track ends. In hh:mm:ss format </li>
        <li><b>In Copyright</b> – whether the track is in copyright. </li>
        <li><b>Copyright End Date</b> – the date the copyright expires. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Modify Track Buttons</b> – click to edit or delete the track. </li>
  </ol>
  <p><b><i>* Collection managers should note that except for the Avalon Item's access determination, metadata created in RMD <b><u>is not available to MCO</u></b>.
    RMD should contain rights-related metadata whereas MCO should contain descriptive metadata. Any descriptive metadata discovered during rights research, that
    a collection manager wishes to appear in MCO, should be added there. </i></b></p>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-lg" id="source">MCO Source Metadata</h3>
  <p>Below the structured metadata, the imported source metadata from MCO is displayed. RMD pulls and displays this
    metadata each time the avalon item is viewed. This affords collections managers with an up-to-date view of MCO metadata.
    This portion of the page also contains the UI controls for association existing people/entities and works to the
    avalon item. See below for more details. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'mco.png', { :class => "scale" } %>



  <h3 class="accordion-title" id="people">People/Entities </h3>
  <p>People/Entities are <i><b>shared across all campus units</b></i>. For instance, there should only be a single instance of
    <i>Ludwig van Beethoven</i> in RMD. Collection managers needing to associate him with a given work, should share the
    same reference not create additional ones. If a collection manager needs to create a new person/entity, navigate to
    the “People/Entities” page via the link at the top right of the RMD webpage. On that page are controls to create new
    people and entities. </p>
  <p>When the "Add Person/Entity” button is clicked, a UI component slides from the right side of the screen halving the
    areas between avalon item and person form. This form allows users to search for existing instances of People/Entities.
    The person form is laid out as follows. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'person a.png', { :class => "scale" } %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Entity Checkbox</b> – Checking this changes the form to reflect an Entity rather than a Person </li>
    <li><b>Person Metadata Fields</b> – With the exception of “Search by Last Name”, these fields display read-only metadata
      for a selected, <i><b>existing</b></i> person
      <ul>
        <li><b>Search by Last Name</b> – This is an autocomplete field for searching for an existing person. Start typing the
          last name of the person to get autocomplete suggestions. Hovering over a suggestion with the mouse will display
          a summary of the suggested person to aid in selection. If “Entity?” is checked, this and other metadata fields
          will reflect an entity rather than a person. Start typing the entity name to search for it.  </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Role Assignment</b> – This section displays the various Roles a person/entity can have related to the avalon item.
      The structured metadata of the avalon item is displayed here and in broken into Recordings -> Performances ->
      Tracks. Roles are the following and can be assigned to
      <ul>
        <li>Each recording in the avalon item is listed here and can have up to two roles: depositor and recording producer </li>
        <li>Each performance in a given recording is displayed here. Performances do not have Roles with people. For
          performances with multiple tracks that a person contributes to, there are convenience buttons to assign a
          given role to all tracks in the performance </li>
        <li>Each track in a performance is listed here and the person can be assigned one or more of the following
          roles: Interviewer, Interviewee, Conductor, and Performer </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="works">Works</h3>
  <p>Like people/entities, works are shared across all campus units. For example, there should only be one instance of
    Beethoven’s <i>Fifth Symphony</i> in RMD. Collection managers needing to associate that work with a given track share
    the same reference. When the “Add Work” button is clicked, A UI component slides from the right halving the page
    between avalon item and the work form. This form allows collection managers to search for existing instances of a
    work. The work form is laid out as follows.  </p>
  <%= image_tag 'work a.png', {class: "scale"} %>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Work Metadata Fields</b> – The metadata fields for the work.
      <ul><li>Search by Title – An autocomplete field for search for the existing work. Start by typing any part of the
        title to see any existing works that match your text. </li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Work Contributors</b> – The People who contributed to the creation of the work. When People have been associated
      with a Work they will appear here with their respective Role. Collection managers can use the search field to
      associate additional People (contributors) to the work.
      <br>
      <%= image_tag 'beethoven contributor.png', {class: "scale"} %>
    </li>
    <li><b>Avalon Item Tracks</b> – The track within the avalon item. Clicking the checkbox for a given track associates
      the select work with that track. </li>
  </ol>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-lg" id="creating_people_works">Creating New People/Entities and Works</h3>
  <p>By navigating to the People/Entities or Works page (located at the top right of the RMD webpage), collection managers
    can create new people/works that can then be associated with avalon items. Each respective lists all existing
    people/works with RMD as well as providing buttons to create new instances. For People/Entities, there are separate
    create buttons for People and Entities.</p>
  <p>The metadata fields for People should be self explanatory with the exception of Authority information. This refers
    to the source from which metadata was gather. This is typically an authority like Library of Congress, VIAF, etc.
    Whenever possible, use an authority source with a permanent URL linking to the record. </p>
  <%= image_tag 'new person.png', {class: "scale"} %>
  <p>The metadata fields for Works should be self-explanatory except for authority information, access determination,
    and Contributors. As with People, whenever possible, works should be identified through an authority source with a
    permanent URL. Works additionally have their own access determination (in copyright, public domain, ect.). Finally,
    collection managers can search for people who contributed to the creation of a work through the autocomplete search
    field to the right of the work. Once an existing person is selected, their role in the creation of the work can be
    set.</p>
  <%= image_tag 'new work.png', {class: "scale"} %>



  <h3 class="accordion-title m-top-md" id="collections">Collections Page</h3>
  <p>In addition to the UI controls for individual avalon items, RMD provides collection managers with some simplified
    tools for mass assigning of certain metadata at the <i>collection</i> level. To access this page, click the "Collections"
    link at the top right of the RMD webpage:</p>
  <%= image_tag 'collections.png', {class: "scale"} %>
  <p>At the top of this page there are three UI controls which provide the means to assign an access determination,
    create a legal agreement, and/or add an avalon item note to every Avalon Item in the selected collections listed
    beneath these controls. Collection managers need only fill out the metadata, check the box for each collection they
    wish to assign this metadata to, and then click the submit button. Every avalon item in each of the selected collections
    will then have the provided metadata assigned to itself.
  </p>
  <p><b><i>* All requirements mentioned in the <a href="#access_reasons">Access Determination and Reasons</a> section of this
    document apply here. The exception being mass assignment of worldwide access with a reason of "Public Domain". This
    reason cannot be massed assigned to Collections as the metadata that describes public domain must be created within
    each avalon item that has that access level.</i></b></p>
